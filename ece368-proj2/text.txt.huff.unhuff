WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue Extension is continuing its "rainscaping" education program by offering another workshop for people interested in learning how to create attractive home or small-scale community rain gardens while minimizing runoff of pollution.

The workshop Sept. 17-18 at the IUPUC Campus Center, 4601 Central Ave. in Columbus, will teach community leaders how to promote community awareness and provide education for rain garden planning, installation and maintenance. It is structured specifically for Purdue master gardeners, personnel in conservation agencies and organizations, storm water professionals, and landscape professionals and consultants.

"Landscapes with rainscaping capture stormwater, which reduces polluted runoff from homes and communities," said Kara Salazar, sustainable communities Extension specialist. "When plants and soils of a rainscaped landscape absorb water from storms, they keep pollution from reaching streams, rivers and lakes."
